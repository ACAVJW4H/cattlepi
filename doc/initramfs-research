or 
man 8 initramfs-tool

for the root filesystem:
look at /usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts 

- need to follow the pattern for local and nfs and potentially add a 3rd BOOT option to use in order to create and mount the root filesystem
- the init (/usr/share/initramfs-tools/init) also needs to be altered to source (source as include) the new scripts

difference between hooks and scripts: hooks run at ramdisk build time, scripts run at boot time
